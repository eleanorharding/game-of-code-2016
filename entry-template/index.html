		<h2>The idea in a nutshell:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>The internet is filled with conflicting information</li>
			<li>Finding the straightforward answer to a health question is a nightmare</li>
			<li>We want to simplify this process</li>
		</ol>
		<p class="note">This app will provide clear, vetted Go/No-Go answers to health questions in specific niche areas. </p>

	<section class="slide grid">
		<h2>I'm <u>pregnant</u>, <br/>can I <u>do pushups</u>?</h2>

		<h2>I'm <u>diabetic</u>, <br/>can I <u>drink alcohol</u>?</h2>

		<h2>In an online world filled with conflicting advice, I want to ask a question and get a clear answer quickly.</h2>
	</section>
	<section class="slide">
		<h2>The Mission:</h2>
		<p>To create and curate a trusted, easy to use database of correct Go/No-Go answers to the world's health-related questions.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="slide">
		<h2>Growth:</h2>
		<p>Targeting a range of hyperniche communities will ensure scalable long term growth </p>
	</section>
	<section class="slide">
		<h2>Partnerships:</h2>
		<p>This app will leverage partnerships with domain experts to sponsor answers. For example, the pregnancy questions could be sponsored by fitpregnancy.com, where they would pay a fee to vouch for the answer and have their site visible as an authoratative link on the answer page </p>
	</section>
	<section class="slide">
		<h2>The App:</h2>
		<p>The MVP will be a web-app built on Node.js. We'll start by building out the database and building tools to scrape content for the database to be used in the webapp. We will then move on to native iOS as a complementary outlet. </p>
